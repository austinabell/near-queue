# near-queue

Experimental NEAR contract - think about combination of Calendly and Wallet.

Where you can export the 'time slots' when you're available, and people can reserve/bid to meet you at this slot.

This contract is also deployed using NEAR web4 server, so you can check it out on https://queue.testnet.page/?queue_id=mm-near.testnet

(and if you have a testnet account - you can create & see your slots on https://queue.testnet.page/?queue_id=YOUR_TESTNET_ID)
